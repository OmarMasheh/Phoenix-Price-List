# Phoenix-Price-List
THIS UPDATE FOR PHOENIX

It shows a list of prices of all the products in our catalog.

It shows an image of the product, the name, the manufacturer and the price even if it is on sale. You can add more fields such as the price without taxes and / or the stock. To do this you have to "play" with the width of the columns.

WARNING: the more products we have, the slower the page load.

Adapted to Phoenix.

Languages English. You can add more languages,
